/*
 * This ViewHelper renders a Pagination of objects.
 *
 * = Examples =
 *
 * <code title="required arguments">
 * <f:widget.paginate objects="{blogs}" as="paginatedBlogs">
 * use {paginatedBlogs} as you used {blogs} before, most certainly inside
 * a <f:for> loop.
 * </f:widget.paginate>
 * </code>
 *
 * <code title="full configuration">
 * <f:widget.paginate objects="{blogs}" as="paginatedBlogs" configuration="{itemsPerPage: 5, insertAbove: 1, insertBelow: 0, maximumNumberOfLinks: 10}">
 * use {paginatedBlogs} as you used {blogs} before, most certainly inside
 * a <f:for> loop.
 * </f:widget.paginate>
 * </code>
 *
 * = Performance characteristics =
 *
 * In the above examples, it looks like {blogs} contains all Blog objects, thus
 * you might wonder if all objects were fetched from the database.
 * However, the blogs are NOT fetched from the database until you actually use them,
 * so the paginate ViewHelper will adjust the query sent to the database and receive
 * only the small subset of objects.
 * So, there is no negative performance overhead in using the Paginate Widget.
